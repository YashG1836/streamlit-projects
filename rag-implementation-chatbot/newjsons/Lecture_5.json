in wild loop, we simply write while which is a reserved keyword we have already talked about reserved keywords we cannot make a variable name as while while in english means till the time this condition remains true till then whatever work is written by colon keep repeating that work till when we have to repeat that work till the time whatever condition we write here remains true that is, its value finally evaluates to be true for example, if I have to print hello 5 times so what can we do for that? for that we can use wild loop and if we write here while true till the time it is true so truth will always remain true till then we want to print hello so how many times will hello be printed? hello will be printed infinitely why? because till the time value of true will always remain true so how many times will hello be printed? hello will always be printed it will never stop for example, as soon as I run this code what is happening? hello is being printed there is no stop to it so that's why we have to kill the terminal so basically here we take such a condition which at some point also becomes false otherwise this loop will continue and hello will continue to print so that's why we generally make some count variable or some other variable which we can initialize with 1 so for example, what is our count now? now our count is 1 and we have to print hello till the time our count does not reach 5 so till the time value of count is less than or equal to 5 till then what we want to do? we want to print hello so let's understand this code properly what will actually happen in this code first of all we have taken value of count which is equal to 1 now count is 1, can we say that 1 is less than or equal to 5? it will give true so in that case we will print hello after that here value of count should increase because if count is 1 then count will always less than or equal to 5 so here we increase value of count by 1 so count will be count plus 1 or we can say that it can be plus or equal to 1 so count will increase with 1 now from count 1 is now 2 2 is less than or equal to 5 so we again print hello then count will increase again and returns 3 3 is also less than or equals to 5 so we again will print hello \uc5ec\uae30 again count will change to 4 4 is less than or equal to 5, then again hello will be printed then count will increase to 5 5 is less than or equal to 5? Yes so again what will happen? we will come in this line and hello will be printed after that what will be the value of count? 6 and as soon as count value becomes 6, is 6 less than or equal to 5? No so what we will do? we will come out of the loop in fact, if we run the code by printing only this much part then what will be printed? on the screen, we will get hello printed 5 times and here at the end if I want to verify what will be the value of count at the end then I know that at the end, the value of count that will be printed will be equal to 6 this value is equal to 6 so this way our loops work so how does the flow of loops remain? first we check the condition, then we get the work done after that there are some updation in any of our variables or it is possible that there may not be any updation after that we check the condition again till the condition is true, work will be done then condition will be checked again, then work will be done then condition will be checked again, then work will be done so in this way, in a loop, in a circle we repeatedly repeat the same work and if we want to stop that work at any time then it is necessary that this condition is false and to make it false, generally we take a variable and this variable, like our count variable we call them iterators we call them iterators and to run in a loop we call it iteration we call this process as iteration one iteration means, we run a loop once second iteration means, we run a loop second time third iteration means, we run a loop third time and the variable with which we run a loop we call it iterator and generally we don't keep count variable we take a small variable, we call it i variable we call it j, x, y so we start with a small variable like here also, if I want to write this same loop in a different way then we take i is equal to 1 what would have happened to i, it would have become our iterator while i is less than equal to 5 print hello this loop will also do the same work and we will make i plus equal to 1 save it and run so here hello is printed 5 times more or in fact, we print some other string here, 5 times so what is this? this is our college written 5 times now just like we wrote a code to print 5 times the same code will be to print 100 times what we have to do is, simply where the end of the loop is happening we have to change that like here instead of 5, if I write 100 then our college will be printed 100 times you can scroll on the screen and you can see that this is printed 100 times similarly, if we want, we can also print it 1 lakh save it, run it what is this? our college is printed 1 lakh times on the screen if we want, we can also print count like this iterator, if we print it then with our college, we can print i save it, run it so what is the last value? 1 lakh before that, what is 99,999? 99,998 and where did this whole counting start from? it started with our number 1 so like this, our loops can be run as many times as we want similarly, if I don't want to print any string what I have to do is, I want to print numbers from 1 to 5 so to print that, what we will do is simply we will take our iterator we can start it with 1 we will write while, till the time my iterator's value is less than or equal to 5 till then what I have to do is, I have to print my i i means my number so first of all, i's value will be 1 after that, we will increase i's value then i's value will be 2, it will be printed here then we will increase i's value again then i's value will be 3 then we will increase it again till then we will keep on doing it till i's value becomes 6 and lastly, if we want we can print loop ended save it and let's run it so we got 1,2,3,4,5 printed and our loop ended now in the same way, we can print 5 to 1 i.e. we can run our loop in reverse"
