some related functions and also we will cover another important concept which are conditional statements which form a core of our python language all the lectures of python series are available on this channel in this playlist, so you can check them out also you can download our notes link is given in the description box below so let's start with our chapter 2 Hi everyone, so let's start with chapter 2 in which we will study about strings strings is a data type, we have already studied this in our first lecture and it stores a sequence of characters means we store a sequence of different characters in the form of strings it can be a single character, it can be a word it can be a whole sentence or a paragraph we have seen 3 ways to create a string for example, in VS code we have already made a file in our folder named lecture2.py so in this python file we are writing our lecture 2 codes if I want to create a string in this so in this way we can make a variable named string1 so we define our string as this is a string so what is this string? it is a sentence which we have stored in the form of string in fact we can create strings in single quotes also if we want we can make a string2 in which we can store a single word enclosed within single quotes and we can do the same thing in triple quotes also we can have a string3 which we can store in the form of this now all these 3 are valid ways to create a string but when we are creating our strings most of the time we will use double quotes because generally when we see other people's code in python so double quotes are used in it or in fact in other programming languages also here we can ask a question that why we need 3 different types of quotes to create strings? it is generally due to the fact for example we want to use apostrophe means we want to use single quotes in our string so how can we use it? for example we want to write this is our college tutorial now if we enclose this string in single quotes then python will get confused how it will get confused? because single quote means that string is starting from here and as soon as we see double quote means that string is ending here so this word and single quote will not make sense to our python interpreter so instead of this type of string in which we want to use single apostrophe we will enclose it in double quotes so this way we will get a valid string and we will enclose apostrophe means single quote also in it but here if we had double quote then we would have enclosed this string in single quote so this way we have different types of quotes available so that we can use single quotes and double quotes inside the string value itself so these were the basic things now let's talk about some more things for example we want to write 2-3 sentences in a string like this is a string we are creating it in python we want to write 2 sentences like this but we want that after printing one sentence we want to print another sentence in the next line but if we try to print next line in our code editor then we get an error because this next line is not valid to print in python so as such generally the way we work in word documents we cannot work in code if we have to print next line in any string so we use these characters so what are these escape sequence characters let me also write it down escape sequence characters are special characters whose job is to give formatting formatting means if we want tab space or next line then we cannot do this type of things directly in code so to do those things we use these characters now if we want to print this string normally let me try to print my string 1 so on our screen our string 1 will be printed like this and i want next line to come here so for that we can write backslash n backslash n is an escape sequence character which means next line whenever a string is printed or there is some operation with it then we should get next line so let's save it and run it this extra space was created in starting because we had extra space before v and in this way we can get next line in our string like we got next line we can also get tab space like if we write backslash t it means this is tab escape sequence character so in this way a tab space came in between our sentences we can use this type of operations whenever we are writing a paragraph or a big line now let's talk about how we can perform different operations on strings first operation is concatenation now concatenation sounds difficult but it is actually very easy like in math we can add two numbers we can write a plus b we can also add two strings like if we add one string 1 and one string 2 then their output will be valid in python and to join two strings we call it concatenation and to join two

length we can find out any string's length using this length function we don't have to worry about functions we will study them in detail later now we can hear the word function so we have to imagine it like it is a magical word which we write and a particular operation is performed similarly in python there are different functions which are inbuilt to perform different functions in python we have len function which is used to calculate a string's length so we can write len and then we will pass any string and we will get its length for example here i want to print string 1 so we can print len of str1 or we can store it in a different variable here we have made a variable and we are storing len and then we are printing len1 similarly we can print len2 let's create another variable let's create another variable length2 let's run it we have 4 characters in our string and 7 characters in our string when we are creating our final string let's suppose we create our final string by adding
