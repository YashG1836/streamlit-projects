our lecture can be found in the description box below from there we can download them and all the lectures related to python can be found in this playlist so let's start with our chapter 3 Hi everyone and now we are going to start with our chapter 3 in python in chapter 3 we are going to cover lists and tuples in python now if we talk about lists first if you have coded in any other programming language then you must have heard about arrays that is a data structure called arrays now in the same python we have lists and tuples now list is a built-in data type that stores set of values for example we are a teacher of a class and we have to store the marks of many students in a class now there must be a way to take our python file here we have made a file in our folder we have made a variable lecture3.py and in this file we have 5 students and we have to store marks of 5 students so first we have to make the first variable marks1 is equal to 94.4 like this then make the second variable marks2 is equal to 87 make the third variable marks3 is equal to 95 make the fourth variable marks4 is equal to 66 and marks5 is equal to 45 like this we have made 5 variables in fact we convert these also to floating values like this we have stored different marks now our class size is limited that is only 5 students tomorrow it may be 50 students or 100 students now for every student for a simple thing like marks if we start making a new variable then we have to track many variables while coding so to simplify this work we have a built in data type built in data type means this data type and its related methods means functions are already written in python we don't have to implement them now if I have to store these marks in a list then we make a single variable marks and we simply write marks.something so what happens marks is equal to 12 means that these marks are an integer variable similarly if I have to store multiple lists of values so to make a list first we write our square brackets and then we start writing our values we can store as many values as we want in a single list and we have to write those values by separating them from a comma like the first value we have is 94.4 we can also give spaces or not its up to us 95.2 66.4 and similarly 45.1 so in this way this built in data type we call it a list in python now this python list we can print it if we want let us try to print our list we have named our list similarly we name a normal variable similarly we have named our list lets save it and run it we have our list we can also print the type of list type of marks save and run so we have a list in front of the class means this type of structure of this data is a list type now many properties of list like in strings there was a concept of indexing we can go to a particular index and extract a character similarly in a list we can access a particular element like for example if we have a list like this if we write marks of 0 then we will get marks of 0th index 1 index will be this 2 index, 3 index and 4 index lets try to print our values we can print here marks of 0 and lets try to print marks of 1 save it and run it so we have marks at 0th index and marks at 1st index and in this way we can access all the indices we can print the length of our list like here instead of type if i type len like we used to print the length of string we can print the length of string save it and refresh so we have 5 which is the length of this list now the list of python is slightly different from the arrays that we create in c++ or java means in c++ or java generally in programming languages the arrays that we read in those arrays the data that we can store should be of same type but in python list there is no such rule so in python list we can store elements of different types together we can make a list of student in which we can store the details of a particular student this is the name of the student and this is the string type this can be marks this is the integer type this can be location, place, state so this is also string type we can add floating values or some other values so in this way we can store the data of student in a single list like if i create a student list so in this we can save the name of the student we can save the marks we can save the age of the student and we can save the location of the student we have saved it and we can print the information of the student and this is going to be a valid list in python now i have said that the list of string and python is very similar but there is a big difference between the two and the difference is that the strings in python are immutable this is a very important point and lists are mutable in python now what is the meaning of mutable and immutable mutate means changing in english mutable means something which can change immutable means something which can't change like we have mortal and immortal which can live and which can't similarly we have mutable and immutable things that can change and that can not change so in python like in strings it was allowed to access the value on index but there it was not allowed to change the value means mutate but in list it is allowed and this is also allowed for example if we take a string let's take an example of a string we have a string hello now if we want we can print str of 0 but if i say that i want to assign value to str of 0 y equal python doesn't allow this operation because strings are immutable it can't change item assignment we can't do this assignment but in list it is possible means we can print str of 0 and in future it is possible that student's name let's say arjun so this thing is completely possible in python in this case python will not return any error and if we want we can print our new list our student list let's save it and run it so we have a new list in which value has changed because list is immutable in python also like in strings there is a limit of index if we make a list let's take an example of this list if index is 0, 1 and 2 so if we try to access index 3 then it will give us an error like here our list we have 4 indices this value is for index 0 this is index 1, this is index 2, this is index 3 so here if i try to write 5, then it will give me an error here we will get an error list index out of range so in the range of indices we can access our values now like in strings string slicing was possible similarly slicing is possible in lists also what was the rule behind slicing? we should have index like in strings index was there similarly in lists also index is there so obviously slicing should be possible here also so here same rules are there which we read in strings we write name of list, starting index and ending index so we get a part of our list which we can call a sub list sub list means part of list sub string was part of string so in sub list from starting index to ending index we get all the values just before similarly in list slicing ending index is not included for example if we have a list of marks and if we write 1 to 4 we need all the sub lists so let's see the index this will be index 0, this will be index 1 this will be index 2"
